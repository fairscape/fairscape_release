      "description": "To enhance the sensitivity of DNA methylome analysis of DNA enriched with hybridization capture technology, a strategy termed post-bisulfite adaptor tagging (PBAT) was applied. This enabled targeted methylome analysis from as little as 30 ng of starting DNA extracted from human and mouse.",
